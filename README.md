# My Math Notes

These notes are written in LaTeX and then compiled down into a pdf.
To build it you will need the pdflatex compiler and run build.sh.

```shell
$ ./build.sh
```

Or alternately you can just use the <a href=https://github.com/Declan-Combley/math-notes/blob/main/main.pdf> current pdf<a>.
